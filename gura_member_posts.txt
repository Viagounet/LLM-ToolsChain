hi hi
its been a while since I  posted a hello on the members-only side-- HI
 i'm okay, sorry if I have been worrying you :(
 with the down time i've had, I really started to pay close attention to myself/health. like what I can and cannot do, and what i def should/shouldnt do-- that kinda stuff. my fainting spells are one of the things i've been dealing with, i've mentioned that on stream before.      mom threatened to make me wear a bike helmet help

u guys..
i was really nervous but, after getting the OK from my doctor, I've officially traveled to JAPAN. I'M HERE!! 
i'm here for 4th fes training O.O i have stories to tell, and I can't wait to make more memories ;;
[[but im also very overwhelmed and want to hide under my blanket. i celebrated when i managed the courage to walk to the vending machine all by myself]]
i am taking everything day by day, and taking it slow. ...i-i am o-okay 

anyways, I want to return to streaming in february!! before valentines day, 12th maybe? around then
i have so much to talk about im bouta bust
